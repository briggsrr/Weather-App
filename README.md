# Weather-App
This project uses JS, CSS, HTML, React.js and some apis to create a weather application. 

Some file/folder descriptions: 
 >  - src/components contains all individual aspects of the app
 >  - api.js contains all api related info
 
Notes: 
> - Currently only available locally.
> - Footer uniquely uses styled components (since same one used as website)
> - Data is not accurate for the accordion due to the limiation of the weather api (you have to pay for more features...)
> - Big shoutout to freecodecamp.com for teaching this project

Further: 
> Add dynamic video background?
> Add mobile support?
