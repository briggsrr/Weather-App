# Weather-App
A web-app that uses react.js, HTML,, CSS,  and REST Apis to enable
visitors to find the several weather data points in any city,
as well as the projected forecast for 
the next 7 days. 

Some file/folder descriptions: 
 >  - src/components contains all individual aspects of the app
 >  - api.js contains all api related info
 
Notes: 
> - Currently only available locally.
> - Footer uniquely uses styled components (since same one used as website)
> - Data is not accurate for the accordion due to the limiation of the weather api (you have to pay for more features...)
> - Big shoutout to freecodecamp.com for teaching this project

Further: 
> Add dynamic video background?
> Add mobile support?
